# D2. Requirements

_Group 02 - "Timely"_\
_Group Members: Brody England, Christian Butler, Dylan Hyer, Ian Nieto, Nyle Huntley, Sofia Mendoza_

## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Problem Statement
The problem of managing and coordinating schedules for academic, work, and personal commitments affects busy university students, the impact of which is reduced productivity, missed deadlines, and increased stress as students struggle to find common meeting times within groups.

### 1.2 Product Position Statement
For university students who have to work and schedule meetings regularly with groups of other students, Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that simplifies compiling your peers' schedules and organizing group meetings; unlike Coursicle.com, our product automates the processes of importing student schedules and finding common meeting times that work for everyone.

### 1.3 Value Proposition and Customer Segment
**Value Proposition:**
Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that helps university students save time and energy by making it easier to find common meeting times, automating the organization of group meetings and collaboration sessions.

**Consumer Segment:**
University students who frequently collaborate on group projects for academic, work, or personal commitments.

## 2. Stakeholders
**Users** - University students who import and update their schedules on Timely

Users are responsible for importing/confirming their schedules and actively using the automated collaboration features to organize meetings efficiently.

**Clients** - Educational institutions and student organizations

Clients can adopt and integrate Timely into existing learning management systems (e.g. Canvas) and provide relevant data such as class schedules and academic calendars.

**Competitors** - Other scheduling/collaboration websites and tools

Competitors offer alternatives and set benchmarks for scheduling and collaboration functionality, prompting Timely to continually improve its unique features and user experience.

**Detractors** - Individuals or groups who may criticize Timely for various reasons

Detractors provide valuable feedback and critique that can highlight potential weaknesses in Timely and prompt the development team to improve its functionality.

**Developers** - The team that designs, builds, and maintains Timely

Developers are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining a functional product as well as collaborating with all other stakeholders to improve Timely.

## 3. Functional Requirements (features)

1. Basic user profiles
2. Import external schedules
3. Update your schedule
4. Set a varying range of meeting time preferences
5. Form a user group to schedule meetings
6. Automatically compile multiple users' schedules
7. Automatically generate common available meeting times
8. Create and respond to meeting invites
9. Notify users of meetings/invitations
10. Private schedules by default

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

1. Availability: Timely's scheduling should be available on on all commonly used desktop and mobile browsers.\
   _Verify that Timely works on all browsers as well as it does on our local machines._
2. Usability: Timely's UI should be simple and easy to use for users; it should appeal to non-tech-savvy users.\
   _Task developers and test users with ensuring all features are easily navigated to and used as intended._
3. Accessibility: Timely's interface should be accessible to users with disabilities.\
   _Ensure compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)._
4. Reliability: Timely should experience minimal downtime or errors in providing its scheduling functionality.\
   _Monitor uptime and error rates through tracking tools with a goal of 99.9% uptime. Stress test by creating large amounts of fake users using automated scheduling simultaneously)._
5. Security: The Timely server should ensure that all user data, including personal information and schedules, is securely stored and transmitted. Additionally, users should have the option to publically display their schedule information.\
   _Ensure only authorized users can access or modify their own data through penetration testing. Ensure schedule information of other users is not fully accessible by default._
6. User profile customization: Users should be able to customize their profiles beyond schedules, such as including a bio and other contact information.\
   _Verify that users can successfully update and save profile information through manual testing and form validation._

## 5. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP for Timely will focus on creating an easy-to-use scheduling tool that helps students stay organized and work together. Users will be able to set up basic profiles, import their schedules from other tools, and update them as needed. Timely will also let users set preferences for when they’re available and create study groups. It will automatically check everyone's schedule and suggest times when they can meet. Users will be able to send meeting invites, respond to them, and get email reminders about upcoming meetings or tasks. All schedules will be private by default, giving users control over who can see them.

In terms of what’s included, the MVP will offer basic user profiles, importing and updating of schedules, automatic scheduling for group meetings, and the ability to send and respond to meeting invites. Notifications for deadlines and tasks will be built-in. Based on early user feedback, personalized scheduling and making group collaboration easy are the main goals.

We’ll also make sure Timely is reliable and works for everyone. It will be accessible on any commonly used desktop or mobile browser, and we’ll test it to make sure it works well across all platforms. The design will be simple so anyone, even if they’re not super tech-savvy, can use it easily. We’ll make sure Timely meets accessibility standards so it can be used by people with disabilities. To keep it reliable, we’ll aim for minimal downtime by running tests with a lot of users at once. Security will be a priority too — only users will have access to their own data, and we’ll do tests to make sure everything is secure. Timely will also let users customize their profiles with things like a bio or contact information.

### 6.2 Use Case Descriptions and Interface Sketches

**Use Case 1.** Making a study group:<br/>
Actor: Registered User <br/>
trigger: selects find study group<br/>
pre-conditions: must be logged in<br/>
post-conditions: creates study group.<br/>
<br/>
Success Scenario:<br/>
1.User goes to make study group<br/>
2.System requests other user profiles to be added to the group<br/>
3.User adds profiles<br/>
4.System sends invites out to those profiles for the study group<br/>
5.Other users accept invites<br/>
6.System adds users to the group<br/>
<br/>
Alternate scenarios:<br/>
3a. User inputs invalid user<br/>
-The system asks for another user and tells the user that profile was invalid.<br/>
<br/>
5a. Users reject the invite<br/>
-the system doesn't add them to the group<br/>
