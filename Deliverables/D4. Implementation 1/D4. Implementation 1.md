## 10. Lessons learned
It's important that everyone is proficient or atleast knowledgable in the coding languages that are being used to have a smoother time with development. We also found that Sometimes drafts are just drafts, and need to be modified or worked around to a point where the final result is a plausible product you can create and be happy with. Teamwork is really important, if you notice that someone is struggking eith something, offfering a helping hand can make all of the difference to the success of a project.

For our next project, doing what we've been doing and working on communications will alsways be helpful as the group gels and finishes up the project. Maybe a little higher speed in finishing the code would be quite helpful. For next project a lot of our processes and what er change will really honestly hinge on the grade we get back on this and then from there we will reflect and make a plan to do better on the next deliverable.
