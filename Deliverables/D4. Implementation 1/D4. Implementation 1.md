# D4. Implementation 1

_Group 02 - "Timely"_\
_Group Members: Brody England, Christian Butler, Dylan Hyer, Ian Nieto, Nyle Huntley, Sofia Mendoza_

## 1. Introduction
Timely helps busy university students save time and energy by making it easier to find and organize group meetings. For this first implementation, Timely features a calendar with the ability to add school classes and events relating to them - all of which is integrated with our database. This sets the base for our next implementation in which we will add automation related features.

## 2. Implemented requirements


## 3. Tests
1. **Test framework:** Unittest and SQLAlchemy's built in database testing

2. **Automated test file:** https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/requirements-documentation/tests/test_app.py

3. **Example test case:** Two main test cases were created for this implementation, including testing for the routing functions and for creating objects in the database from models. Within ModelTestCases, test_create_event, for example, tests the successful creation of an Event object in the database. The Event model can be found here: https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/requirements-documentation/app.py

4. **Result of automated test execution:**
Testing was executed locally through cloned repository.

## 4. Adopted technologies
SQL (Postgre or Lite): In the Timely project, we use an SQL database, with options for either SQLite or PostgreSQL, as the core data management layer. SQLite offers a lightweight, file-based solution that’s easy to set up for development and smaller-scale deployments, making it ideal for local testing. For production, PostgreSQL brings more advanced features, like transactional integrity, concurrent connections, and scalability, aligning with the collaborative nature of Timely. The database handles essential data structures—user profiles, schedules, group meetings, and notifications—allowing efficient retrieval and management of student data. This setup is crucial for Timely's functionality, particularly for quickly fetching schedules and integrating with external systems like Canvas. The relational model also allows us to maintain organized relationships, which is key to Timely’s automation of group meeting arrangements and classmate matching.

Linux: In the Timely project, Linux serves as the underlying operating system, providing a secure, stable, and customizable environment that's ideal for web applications. Hosting Timely on a Linux server offers flexibility and efficiency, especially when managing dependencies and handling web traffic in a resource-effective way. We can leverage a reverse proxy to route traffic from localhost:5000 to the publicly accessible timely.brodyengland.com, ensuring smooth access for users without exposing the development port. This setup allows Timely to function securely and reliably online, managing DNS, SSL, and firewall settings within Brody's Linux Server, all of which are crucial for maintaining the integrity and accessibility of the app for university students collaborating and organizing schedules.

GitHub: For the Timely project, GitHub serves as the version control and collaboration platform, allowing the team to manage, track, and contribute to the codebase efficiently. Hosting the project on GitHub enables us to maintain a clear history of changes, manage issues, and document progress, which is essential for a collaborative university project. By centralizing the Timely repository on GitHub, each team member can contribute, review code, and coordinate updates seamlessly. GitHub’s pull request and branching features allow us to implement new features or fix bugs in an organized manner, minimizing conflicts and maintaining code quality. Additionally, the repository’s accessibility from anywhere supports continuous integration and deployment workflows, making it easy to pull updates to our YunoHost server and keep the application at timely.brodyengland.com in sync with the latest developments.

Bootstrap: In the Timely project, Bootstrap is integrated to streamline the front-end development process, providing a responsive and visually cohesive design framework that accelerates UI creation. By leveraging Bootstrap's pre-built components and grid system, we ensure that Timely is both user-friendly and adaptable across different devices and screen sizes, which is critical for a student-centered scheduling tool. Using Bootstrap allows us to maintain design consistency with minimal custom styling, enabling the team to focus more on functionality while delivering a polished interface. Components like modals, navigation bars, and responsive layouts contribute to an intuitive user experience on timely.brodyengland.com, ensuring that students can easily access schedules, manage group meetings, and collaborate without any usability issues across various devices

## 5. Learning/training
In the Timely project, the team adopted a multi-pronged strategy to effectively learn and integrate technologies such as Flask, SQL (PostgreSQL and SQLite), GitHub, Linux, and Bootstrap. We began by dividing research responsibilities based on individual strengths and prior experience, enabling focused deep dives into each tool. For example, one member took the lead in mastering Flask’s routing and middleware capabilities, while another specialized in SQL database operations to optimize our data models. To solidify our understanding, we engaged in hands-on excersizes, where team members walked each other through setups, configurations, and practical coding sessions. This collaborative learning approach not only built collective knowledge but also created consistency in the project’s development standards. Additionally, we utilized online resources and community forums to address specific challenges, such as setting up Ya reverse proxy for secure external access and implementing Bootstrap’s grid system to create responsive layouts. Regular code reviews and discussions further reinforced our understanding, ensuring that everyone was aligned in effectively applying each technology in Timely. This cohesive strategy allowed us to build a unified, scalable platform while fostering a deeper technical proficiency across the team.

## 6. Deployment
**Production Link:** timely.brodyengland.com

**Deployment workflow:** Update local repo from remote repo, develop and make changes locally, push changes to appropriate branch, get approval and merge changes into main/final product branch, pull changes from final product branch to server and activate flask application. This deployment allows us to ensure we have a final product before we push it to Brody's server, from that server Brody set up a reverse proxy that when a product is opened on 127.0.0.1:5000 it then translates and exposes it to the web via Brody's subdomain timely.brodyengland.com. This allows users to utilize a secure HTTPS connection to Brody's server along with allows the product to work off of the hardware of the system he has this server deployed onto, ensuring as much up-time as possible. Our use of SQL also ensures everytime we deploy the product that the system is maintained and data is not lost.


## 7. Licensing
For licensing, we've adopted the MIT License: [LICENSE](LICENSE.md). We chose the MIT License for its simplicity and permissiveness, encouraging the free use and moficiation of our code and matching the needs of our relatively simplistic project scope.

Our approach with this look was to have a blue and white themed webpage with soft aspects and smooth corners, along with that an intuitive interface that is easy to read, understand, and navigate back and forth between pages to allow users to accomplish whatever it is that they want to from this. 


## 10. Lessons learned
It's important that everyone is proficient or atleast knowledgable in the coding languages that are being used to have a smoother time with development. We also found that sometimes drafts are just drafts, and need to be modified or worked around to a point where the final result is a plausible product you can create and be happy with. Teamwork is really important, if you notice that someone is struggling eith something, offfering a helping hand can make all of the difference to the success of a project.

For our next project, doing what we've been doing and working on communications will always be helpful as the group gels and finishes up the project. Maybe a little higher speed in finishing the code would be quite helpful. A lot of our processes and what we change will really hinge on the grade we get back on this and then from there we will reflect and make a plan to do better on the next deliverable.
