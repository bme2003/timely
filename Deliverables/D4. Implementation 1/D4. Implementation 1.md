# D4. Implementation 1

_Group 02 - "Timely"_\
_Group Members: Brody England, Christian Butler, Dylan Hyer, Ian Nieto, Nyle Huntley, Sofia Mendoza_

## 1. Introduction


## 2. Implemented requirements


## 3. Tests
1. **Test framework:** Unittest and SQLAlchemy's built in database testing

2. **Automated test file:** https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/requirements-documentation/tests/test_app.py

3. **Example test case:** Two main test cases were created for this implementation, including testing for the routing functions and for creating objects in the database from models. Within ModelTestCases, test_create_event, for example, tests the successful creation of an Event object in the database. The Event model can be found here: https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/requirements-documentation/app.py

4. **Result of automated test execution:**
Testing was executed locally through cloned repository.

## 10. Lessons learned
It's important that everyone is proficient or atleast knowledgable in the coding languages that are being used to have a smoother time with development. We also found that sometimes drafts are just drafts, and need to be modified or worked around to a point where the final result is a plausible product you can create and be happy with. Teamwork is really important, if you notice that someone is struggling eith something, offfering a helping hand can make all of the difference to the success of a project.

For our next project, doing what we've been doing and working on communications will always be helpful as the group gels and finishes up the project. Maybe a little higher speed in finishing the code would be quite helpful. A lot of our processes and what we change will really hinge on the grade we get back on this and then from there we will reflect and make a plan to do better on the next deliverable.
