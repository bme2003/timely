## 3. Interviews summary

### 1. Jesse Quinones Jr.

Nyle Huntley interviewed Jesse Quinones Jr.

**When** 

17 September 2024

**Customer segments represented** 

University student, Business major

**Key insights from the interview**

For people with busy schedules that need to schedule meetings, the website would be very helpful. Some kind of integration with Canvas or any platform where other course material is stored would be great. Automatically importing class schedules would be a useful feature, but privacy for peoples' class schedules is very important. People might necessarily want to share all or any of their class schedules, so having a way to obscure schedules and just show general availability of everyone would be nice. Importing class assignment deadlines into schedules would be useful to keep everybody on track. Jesse doesn't mind putting together meeting times with small groups or if it's just a one-off meeting. However, he shared that repeated meetings or meetings with large (6+) member counts would be annoying to organize without some tool.

**Representative quotes**

When asked what he thought about group meetings outside of class, Jesse said "I hate having to schedule meetings with my groups, it's such a tedious process"

**Assessment**

Nice to Have - would rather have the scheduling tool than not have it\
Must have - optional privacy features to hide your schedule from group members is very important

**Representative quotes**

"Scheduling f***ing sucks man, making a tool to allow students to not worry about that issue makes things so much easier."\
In regards to the automated scheduling tool, Aiden said "That would make my life so much more comfortable... Having something to just do that for us would be so nice."

**Key insights from the interview**

The interviewee finds scheduling meetings for group projects or study sessions challenging due to conflicting schedules, such as part-time jobs and varying class times.

Such a tool would be a "game-changer," helping them stay on track and reduce stress.

**Representative quotes**

On Time Management: "I definitely struggle with that. I either end up wasting time on social media or get caught up in one thing for too long, and before I know it, the day’s gone."

On Connecting with Classmates: "It’s hit or miss. In some classes, people seem really open to talking and forming groups, but in others, it can feel like everyone is in their own world."

On Using a Schedule Organizer: "That would honestly be a game-changer! If something could help me plan my time better and prioritize what I need to do, I’d be all for it."

On Interest in Time Management Tools: "Definitely! I think it would really help me stay on track and feel less stressed."

### 9. Austin Butler

Christian Butler interviewed Austin Butler
**When**
21 September 2024

**Customer segments represented**
University student, Mechanical Engineering and Japenese major

**Key insights from the interview**
The Automated Schedule and Network Developing Tool (Timely) has potential, but a few things might need improvement to really grab students' attention.

One concern is how easy the tool will be to use. Students are already juggling a lot, and if the tool is too complicated or takes too long to set up, they might not want to use it. It would be important to keep things simple and quick to understand.

Another worry is how useful the tool would be for people with flexible or changing schedules. Not everyone’s availability stays the same, so having a way to easily adjust schedules on the go would be important. The tool needs to be adaptable for last-minute changes without causing too much hassle.

There’s also the question of whether students will see the benefit of using it. If it’s just another tool added on top of everything else they already use, it could feel like extra work. Making sure the tool clearly helps save time and effort will be key to getting students interested.

**Representative quotes**
On ease of use, Austin said, "If it's hard to figure out or takes too long to set up, I probably wouldn’t bother using it."
When talking about flexible schedules, she mentioned, "I need something I can easily change if my plans shift. If it's a hassle to update, it won’t work for me."

**Assessment**
Nice to Have – A feature that automatically updates or adjusts for last-minute schedule changes.
Must Have – Simple and user-friendly design to make sure students can easily use it without wasting time.

### 10. Julianna Garcia

Christian Butler interviewed Julianna Garcia

**When**
21 September 2024

**Customer segments represented**
University student, Exercise Science major

**Key insights from the interview**
The Automated Schedule and Network Developing Tool (Timely) sounds like a useful tool, especially for students trying to manage their schedules and connect with classmates. However, there are a few concerns that might need attention to get people interested.

One of the main concerns is privacy. While it's nice to match students based on their classes and free time, not everyone would want to share their whole schedule with others. It would be better to give students options to hide parts of their schedule and only show when they are available for group work or meetings.

Another thing is that students might want to have control over how they use the tool. Some people may not want to join study groups or meet outside of class unless it's required. Having an opt-in feature, where students can decide if they want to join groups, would be a good way to keep everyone comfortable using the tool.

Lastly, while connecting with classmates can be helpful, some students might prefer studying on their own. It’s important that the tool doesn’t make users feel pressured to always collaborate and instead gives options for both group and solo study.

**Representative quotes**
When talking about privacy, Julianna said, "I’d rather have control over what parts of my schedule people can see. Showing when I’m free is fine, but not everything."

**Assessment**
Nice to Have – Suggestions for study groups and meeting times based on shared courses.
Must Have – Privacy settings so users can control what’s shared, and an option for students to join groups only if they want to.
