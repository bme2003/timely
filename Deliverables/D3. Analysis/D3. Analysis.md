## 1. System Description
The tedious and time-consuming problem of managing and coordinating schedules for academic, work, and personal commitments affects busy university students, the impact of which is reduced productivity, missed deadlines, and increased stress as students struggle to find common meeting times within groups. For university students who have to work and schedule meetings regularly with groups of other students, Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that simplifies compiling your peers' schedules and organizing group meetings; unlike Coursicle.com, our product automates the processes of importing student schedules and finding common meeting times that work for everyone. Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that helps university students save time and energy by making it easier to find common meeting times, automating the organization of group meetings and collaboration sessions.

The **UniversityStudent** can create a **_profile_** in **Timely**, where they can set up *username*, *email*, and *password*. They are able to import their *classSchedule*, allowing them to automatically sync their academic commitments. A **_classSchedule_** is an essential part of the system as it enables the **UniversityStudent** to visualize their available time and organize their **StudyGroup**s more efficiently. Each **UniversityStudent** can update their *availabilityPreferences*, which defines their preferred meeting times for **StudyGroup**s or other collaborative efforts. One of the key features of **Timely** is the ability for **UniversityStudent**s to automatically generate common available meeting times by combining their **_availabilityPreferences_** with those of other **UniversityStudent**s in the same **StudyGroup**. When a common time is found, the system **_createsMeetingInvite_**, allowing users to send it to the involved group members. This ensures that all users are aware of their upcoming meetings and collaboration opportunities. From a privacy standpoint, **Timely** ensures that all *classSchedule* information is private by default. Users can modify their *visibilitySettings* to decide who can view their schedules. The system is accessible on all commonly used desktop and mobile browsers, and the user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, even for non-tech-savvy users. In terms of system requirements, **Timely** must work across commonly used desktop and mobile browsers, providing a seamless experience for **UniversityStudent**s on multiple devices. **_Notifications_** for meeting invitations, deadlines, and collaboration requests will ensure that users are always kept up to date. Additionally, **Timely** provides the option to customize **_notifications_** to match individual preferences. In summary, **Timely** is designed to serve the needs of **UniversityStudent**s by automating the scheduling process, facilitating group collaboration, and providing secure, accessible, and reliable scheduling tools. With its focus on reducing student stress and improving productivity, **Timely** stands out as an innovative solution for the modern student.
