The tedious and time-consuming problem of managing and coordinating schedules for academic, work, and personal commitments affects busy university students, the impact of which is reduced productivity, missed deadlines, and increased stress as students struggle to find common meeting times within groups. For university students who have to work and schedule meetings regularly with groups of other students, Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that simplifies compiling your peers' schedules and organizing group meetings; unlike Coursicle.com, our product automates the processes of importing student schedules and finding common meeting times that work for everyone. Timely is a scheduling and collaboration web app that helps university students save time and energy by making it easier to find common meeting times, automating the organization of group meetings and collaboration sessions.

The key functionalities of the **Timely** system include **profiles**, **schedule importing**, **meeting scheduling**, and **notifications**. **Users** can create a **profile** with personal *details* and upload their *class schedules* via the **schedule import** functionality. The system allows **users** to create **user groups**, where the system **automatically compiles schedules** of all group members to find common available times for meetings. **Timely** also allows **users** to set their *meeting preferences*, ensuring that all suggested meeting times align with their availability. The **notifications** system sends reminders for upcoming meetings or pending *invitations*, ensuring that **users** stay up-to-date with all events and deadlines.

**Security** and **privacy** are central to the system design. By default, all *schedules* are private, and only authorized **users** can access or modify their own *data*. **Timely** ensures that **user profiles** and *schedule information* are secure through regular security testing and encryption. **Availability** is another critical feature, as the system is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile platforms, ensuring that **users** can manage their schedules from anywhere. Furthermore, **Timely** includes options for profile customization, such as the ability to add a *bio* or *contact information*, enhancing the overall user experience.

Finally, **Timely** is designed to be reliable, with minimal downtime and support for many concurrent **users** through performance monitoring and stress testing. By offering features like automatic meeting time identification, **meeting invitations**, and *custom notifications*, **Timely** ensures that **users** can effectively manage their commitments and collaborate efficiently.
