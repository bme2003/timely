# D6. Implementation 2

_Group 02 - "Timely"_\
_Group Members: Brody England, Christian Butler, Dylan Hyer, Ian Nieto, Nyle Huntley, Sofia Mendoza_

## 1. Introduction
Timely helps busy university students save time and energy by making it easier to find and organize group meetings. This second implementation adds to our previous implementation's rudimentary calendar system with features: User profiles, study group formation and management, automated group schedule aggregation and meeting suggestions, and meeting invites and notifications. All of these features accomplish our initial MVP of an automated scheduling tool. We've also added additional features that massively improve the user experience, including automated class and event importing from Canvas, a messaging system, as well as a file sharing system for any group documents.

## 2. Implemented requirements

## 3. Tests

### 3.1 Unit tests
1. **Test framework:** Unittest and SQLAlchemy's built-in database testing

2. **Automated test file:** https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/main/tests/test_app.py

3. **Example test case:** The test_mocked_fetch_canvas_events test case creates a mock object consisting of data that might be pulled from a Canvas calendar event and ensures proper error handling by sending a request to the Canvas event importing endpoint, checking for a Canvas client error, and ensuring the error message displays properly.

4. **Result of automated test execution:**
Testing executed locally through cloned repository again; only newly added unit tests for Implementation 2 were ran here.

## 5. Code quality
To ensure that we have good code quality we have been using comments and using refactoring techniques to prevent code smell. A couple of these refactoring techniques that we've been putting an emphasis on are removing dead code and the extract function technique. To accomplish the removal of dead code we scan every function after it's written and make sure we don't have any redundancies so that way the code stays cleaner. The extract function technique is applied in a very similar way, we go back through our function and see if anything can be handled as its own function to make the code run smoother. 

Code commenting is relatively controversial but we agree as a team that using comments on our code is necessary so that the code is easier to read in case we need to fix an error, especially if we have to fix someone else's error. Comments were definitely a necessary evil in our code and have helped us develop it immensely.

## 6. Lessons learned
Our team learned the importance of starting deliverables earlier to reduce last-minute stress, prioritizing core functionalities like backend fixes over enhancements, and integrating testing throughout development to ensure reliability. Clearer role assignments and regular progress reviews improved task accountability, while better communication and feedback loops could further streamline future work. Moving forward, we will focus on these areas to enhance efficiency and deliver higher-quality results.
