# D6. Implementation 2

_Group 02 - "Timely"_\
_Group Members: Brody England, Christian Butler, Dylan Hyer, Ian Nieto, Nyle Huntley, Sofia Mendoza_

## 1. Introduction
Timely helps busy university students save time and energy by making it easier to find and organize group meetings. This second implementation adds onto our previous implementation's rudimentary calendar system with features: User profiles, study group formation and management, automated group schedule aggregation and meeting suggestions, and meeting invites and notifications. All of these features accomplish our initial MVP of an automated scheduling tool. We've also added additional features that massively improve the user experience, including automated class and event importing from Canvas, a messaging system, as well as a file sharing system for any group documents.

## 3. Tests

### 3.1 Unit tests
1. **Test framework:** Unittest and SQLAlchemy's built-in database testing

2. **Automated test file:** https://github.com/bme2003/timely/blob/main/tests/test_app.py

3. **Example test case:** The test_mocked_fetch_canvas_events test case creates a mock object consisting of data that might be pulled from a Canvas calendar event and ensures proper error handling by sending a request to the Canvas event importing endpoint, checking for a Canvas client error, and ensuring the error message displays properly.
