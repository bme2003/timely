# Timely: A Scheduling and Collaboration Tool

**Timely** is a web application designed to streamline scheduling and collaboration for university students. The app enables users to fill out detailed profiles based on their academic major, import schedules from existing
learning management systems (such as Canvas), and find peers enrolled in the same classes. By automating the process of identifying common availability, Timely facilitates the organization of group meetings and study sessions. 
Additional features include task management, notifications, and calendar integrations, making it a comprehensive tool for academic collaboration. Hosted on a Linux server and built using Python with Flask for the backend, 
Timely aims to enhance student productivity and coordination.

The system is developed by Group 02 and is hosted at [https://timely.brodyengland.com](https://timely.brodyengland.com). Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient scheduling solution that integrates effortlessly 
with students' existing workflows, enabling better collaboration and time management.
