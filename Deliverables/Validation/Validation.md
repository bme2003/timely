# Timely: A Scheduling and Collaboration Tool

**Timely** is a web application designed to streamline scheduling and collaboration for university students. The app enables users to fill out detailed profiles based on their academic major, import schedules from existing
learning management systems (such as Canvas), and find peers enrolled in the same classes. By automating the process of identifying common availability, Timely facilitates the organization of group meetings and study sessions. 
Additional features include task management, notifications, and calendar integrations, making it a comprehensive tool for academic collaboration. Hosted on a Linux server and built using Python with Flask for the backend, 
Timely aims to enhance student productivity and coordination.

The system is developed by Group 02 and is hosted at [https://timely.brodyengland.com](https://timely.brodyengland.com). Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient scheduling solution that integrates effortlessly 
with students' existing workflows, enabling better collaboration and time management.

## Reflections

**What Worked Well:**
Users overall really enjoyed the easability to import their canvas calendars into the application and view them by class, as for every user interviewed they were able to import it and navigate it afterward, matching it to the Canvas counterpart. 

**Areas for Improvement:**
The design was a little lack luster to users, namely users had issues navigating from the calendar view but once they understood the layout they were able to use the product effectively.

**Learning Curve:**
Users required little to no guidance with the product, once I had them signed in and using the product they were able to get the majority of it down themselves.

**Task Performance:**
Every task I had the user's operate worked as intended, one of the users calendars took a long time to import however which worried them, which I believe was simply due to the amount of content in their calendar.

**User Preferences:**
- What did the users like the most? They really liked the ability to import the calendar from canvas, the instructions and usability were very simple and easy to follow.
- Was the value proposition accomplished? It was, as users felt sastified with what they were told the product does and were able to complete every task successfully.
